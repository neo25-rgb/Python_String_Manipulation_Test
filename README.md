# Python_String_Manipulation_Test

Python String Manipulation Challenge

Overview

This project is a set of Python challenges designed to test your skills in string manipulation.

Files

string_manipulation.py: This is the file you will edit. It contains several function "stubs" (empty functions). Your task is to write the code inside each function to make it work as described.

string_manipulation_tests.py: This file contains all the unit tests that will check your code. Do not edit this file.

Instructions

Open the string_manipulation.py file.

Implement the logic for each function, one by one.

To check your work, run the test file from your terminal:

python -m unittest string_manipulation_tests.py


The test results will show you which functions passed and which ones failed. Your goal is to make all tests pass.

The Problems

The problems are arranged from easy to hard.

Easy Problems

to_uppercase(input_string)

Task: Converts a given string to all uppercase letters.

to_lowercase(input_string)

Task: Converts a given string to all lowercase letters.

count_char(input_string, char_to_count)

Task: Counts the number of times a specific character (char_to_count) appears in the input_string. This check should be case-sensitive.

Medium Problems

reverse_string(input_string)

Task: Reverses a given string.

reverse_sentence(input_string)

Task: Reverses the order of words in a sentence, but not the words themselves.

is_palindrome(input_string)

Task: Checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward). The check must be case-insensitive and should ignore spaces and punctuation.

Hard Problems

is_anagram(string1, string2)

Task: Checks if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in the same quantities). The check must be case-insensitive and ignore spaces.

format_date(date_string)

Task: Converts a date string from the format "13 november 2025" into the format "13/11/2025". The function must handle different capitalizations for the month names.
